to run code
  run the shell script associated with the algorithm. by default it runs all the programs but you can comment out the ones that you don't want to run by editing the run.sh file

data_files should be in a directory called "data", this is the directory that was first handed out to us when the project started. run the program in a directory containing the code and the data like below. notice the data and code to run are in a directory at the same level
  < directory to run program in >
    < data >
    < code to run >

to insepct code
  1. open file
  2. at the bottom of each file is a function that is called to run all the code
  3. start inspection there
